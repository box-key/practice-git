# Practice Git!

## Practice fetch!
* `git fetch origin` copies all data in the remote repo. All remote branches can be referenced by `origin/<branch_name>`. E.g., `origin/master` is different from `master`
* `git fetch origin <branch_name>` copies a remote branch into local. It can be referenced by `origin/<branch_name>`
